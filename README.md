Private Financial Control

That is another simple app bilding in Python3 and Django2 with the propouse to learning and improve my skills in this plataform.
This project will provide one app to control your private financial.

You will have inputs, outputs also balance categorized.

I don't know yet, but if I have patience, could have a pie chart or something like that (we'll see ;) )

Today I created two simple apps (Categories and Inputs).
Keep in mind that it's for learning porpouses. I know that there are a bunch of things to increase, but for now that's it ;)

Today I created OUTPUTS app already with relationship with category.In aditional was changed the app INPUTS to have also relationship with category. For this I deleted the DB and rebuilded it. It was necessary (not necessary but it was easier to do) because the table inputs already had some rows and the field "category" was not empty and this genetered some conflicts.
